# Big-Data-Challenge-2020-Finalist-Project
My team and I went to the finals for the Stem Fellowship Big Data Challenge 2020. We evaluated the impacts of tourism and travel on COVID19 deaths at the international, domestic, and local levels. Used python to create a machine learning algorithm that took in previous tourism data and predicted infection rates.


Used structured google mobility data. Linear Regression used to model.
